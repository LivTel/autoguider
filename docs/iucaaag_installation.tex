\section{Introduction}

This document acts as a ``quick start'' to the Autoguider system
developed by LJMU for the  IUCAA 2.0 metre telescope.  The system
is based on a modification of the system in use at the Liverpool
Telescope and is usually controlled in operation via the command line 
Telescope Control System (TCS) interface.  No support is provided for
the original TTL GUI interface.

No recommendations or information is presented regarding
the physical installation of the autoguider or control computer onto
the telescope itself, as that is the responsibility of IUCAA.

This document suggests some basic tests that can be carried out on
a workbench before installation, and outlines the basic steps
necessary to commission the system on sky.  It assumes the installer is
familiar with basic linux system administration and operation of the
IUCAA telescope.  Since LJMU have never visited the IUCAA telescope we
can take no responsibility for the accuracy or safety of these
instructions, which are merely provided in good faith and without any
implied warranty.

In addition to this document, also supplied are

\begin{itemize}
\item Autoguider User Guide - this provides details of operation of
  the system once installed, including operation via the TCS, command
  line tools, routine calibration procedures and system
  power up and power down routines.
\item Autoguider Configuration Guide - this provides details of configuration file
  and  command line arguments that can be used to tune the operation of the autoguider
\item Autoguider Control System Overview - this provides a description
  of how the system works as an aid to fault finding.  It also
  includes a description low level engineering software that may be of
  use in that process.
\item Autoguider Control Computer Operating System and Software
  installation - this provides the details that would be necessary in
  the event of the system having to be rebuilt on a fresh control
  computer.
\item Autoguider Source Code Overview - this describes the supplied
  source code and how to build it.  It should only be necessary to use
  this information in the event of wanting to change the software in
  some way.
\end{itemize}

In addition a copy of the TTL document T2-010-5180 
"Generic 2.0m Telescope Astronomical Commissioning Installation
Procedure"  
is included which has some useful information on system setup and
geometry.


\section{Terminology}

The supplied documentation makes use of the phrase ``robotic
software''.  This is the ARI phrase used for the software
that runs on the autoguider control computer in normal,
manual operation and starts automatically (``robotically'') on system
reboot.  The robotic software can be controlled
either by the by the TTL Telescope Control System (TCS) or various
command line tools.  It specifically does not imply  ``robotic
control''  of the telescope.

\section{Unpacking}

The following items should have been shipped:

\begin{itemize}
\item The FLI camera head.
\item The FLI camera head power supply, leads and USB cable.
\item The eeePC autoguider control computer.
\item The eeePC mounting plate and stand.
\item The eeePC power block and associated leads.
\item A DVD containing source code, a copy of the installation and
this documentation.
\end{itemize}

The eeePC comes pre-installed with the robotic autoguider software. A copy of the
code used to produce this is also included on the disk. Documentation will also be provided, either
electronically on disk and DVD, or physically on paper.

Note that we strongly recommend a copy is made of the hard disk in the
control computer to allow a re-installation in the case of disk failure.

\section{Control computer}

For initial bench testing this will need to be connected to a monitor, keyboard and mouse. It should not be connected to the network initially.

\subsection{Power on}

The autoguider control computer is currently setup to boot when power is applied to it. So the computer should power up automatically. If it does not, there is a round power button on the front of the computer. Press it to power the machine up :- it lights with a blue LED when power is applied.

The computer should go through a standard Centos boot sequence, and eventually arrive at a command line login prompt. The computer is configured to {\em not} start a graphical user interface automatically, as this is not used for robotic operation.

\subsection{Login}

The usernames and passwords for the control computer are specified in the IUCAA software installation instructions \cite{bib:iucaasoftwareinstallation}, Section 4 (Users and Passwords). The {\bf eng} user is used for normal operations, but to change some system config files you need to be {\bf root}.

After logging in to the autoguider, type {\bf startx} to start a graphical user interface.

\subsection{Network configuration}

The network has been configured in the same way as the autoguider fitted to the Liverpool Telescope. This may {\bf not} be correct for the IUCAA telescope, and needs checking.

The Networks settings box can be displayed by selecting the  {\bf System \textgreater Preferences \textgreater Network connections} menu option, see Figure \ref{fig:networkconnections1}.

		\end{picture}
	\end{center}
	\caption{\em Network Connections Menu.}
	\label{fig:networkconnections1} 
\end{figure}

This brings up the {\bf Network Connections} dialog. By selecting {\bf System eth0} and pressing the {\bf Edit} button the {\bf Editing System eth0} dialog can be brought up as shown in Figure \ref{fig:networkconnections2}. This allows you to edit the IP Address, Netmask and Gateway.

		\end{picture}
	\end{center}
	\caption{\em Editing System eth0.}
	\label{fig:networkconnections2} 
\end{figure}

On the Liverpool Telescope these need to be set as shown in Table \ref{tab:autogudiernetworksettings}.

\begin{table}[!h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{20em}|}
\hline
{\bf Name} & {\bf Value}   \\ \hline
Address    & 192.168.1.3   \\ \hline
Netmask    & 255.255.255.0 \\ \hline
Gateway    & 192.168.1.254 \\ \hline
DNS Server & blank         \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{\em Autoguider network settings.}
\label{tab:autogudiernetworksettings}
\end{table}

On the IUCAA telescope they will need to be set as the old TTL autoguider was setup, so the TCS, SDB and MCP know
the location of the autoguider machine.

\subsubsection{/etc/hosts file}

The {\bf /etc/hosts} file contains the network addresses of machine the autoguider needs to communicate with. The file is setup as shown in the IUCAA software installation instructions \cite{bib:iucaasoftwareinstallation}, Section 8.2. The autoguider software needs the names {\bf mcc} , {\bf scc} and {\bf tcc} in the {\bf /etc/hosts} file, as these names are used in the autoguider configuration file and therefore looked up by the autoguider software when configuring software connections to the TCS (tcc), SDB (mcc), and MCP (scc). If the IP addresses differ on the IUCAA telescope they must be changed.

\subsection{Network testing}
\label{sec:networktesting}

When it is possible to connect the control computer to the telescope LAN the network settings can be tested. The following should be tested:

\begin{itemize}
\item From an autoguider terminal prompt, {\bf ping tcc} successfully transmits packets to and from the tcc. Here is an example of a successful ping:
\begin{verbatim}
[eng@acc ~]> ping tcc
PING tcc.lt.com (192.168.1.10) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from tcc.lt.com (192.168.1.10): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.996 ms
64 bytes from tcc.lt.com (192.168.1.10): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.244 ms
64 bytes from tcc.lt.com (192.168.1.10): icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.234 ms
64 bytes from tcc.lt.com (192.168.1.10): icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.238 ms

--- tcc.lt.com ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 2999ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.234/0.428/0.996/0.327 ms
\end{verbatim}
Use Ctrl-C to quit from the ping command.
\item From an autoguider terminal prompt, {\bf ping mcc} successfully transmits packets to and from the mcc.
\item From an autoguider terminal prompt, {\bf ping scc} successfully transmits packets to and from the scc.
\item Log into the mcc. From an mcc terminal prompt, {\bf ping acc} transmits packets to and from the autoguider. You may have to check {\bf acc} is setup correctly on the mcc, {\bf cat /etc/hosts} to find the autoguider entry. You may have to issue a {\bf slay ping} from a second mcc terminal to stop the ping, rather than using Ctrl-C.
\item From a machine on the telescope LAN, try {\bf ssh eng@acc} (if the machine has acc in the {\bf /etc/hosts}) or {\bf ssh eng@192.168.1.3} (replacing the IP address with the autoguider's if the IUCAA autoguider has a different IP address). You may have to use a different machine from the mcc for this test, it appears the Liverpool Telescopes ssh on mcc is {\bf not} compatible with the ssh on our autoguider machine. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Connecting the camera head}

To connect the camera head, The USB cable between the camera and control computer must be plugged in. The power supply brick can then be plugged into the camera head, and then into mains power and turned on.

If the control computer was turned on with the camera head plugged in and switched on, then it will automatically start the robotic software. If the camera head is plugged in after the control computer was switched on and fully booted, then the robotic software will have tried to start and failed (as no camera head was detected when the software was started).

You can tell if the robotic software is running by issuing the following command from a shell logged on to the autoguider control computer: {\bf ps waux | grep autoguider}. If the robotic software is running you will see something like the following:
\begin{verbatim}
[eng@acc ~]> ps waux | grep autoguider
root      2737  0.0  0.0   4532  1068 ?        S    10:36   0:00 /bin/sh -c ( 
cd /icc/bin/autoguider/c/i386-linux ; 
./autoguider -co autoguider.properties -autoguider_log_level 5 -ccd_log_level 5 
-command_server_log_level 5 -object_log_level 5 -ngatcil_log_level 5 1> 
/icc/log/autoguider_output.txt 2>&1 )
root      2738  0.0  0.0   4532   444 ?        S    10:36   0:00 /bin/sh -c ( 
cd /icc/bin/autoguider/c/i386-linux ; 
./autoguider -co autoguider.properties -autoguider_log_level 5 -ccd_log_level 5 
-command_server_log_level 5 -object_log_level 5 -ngatcil_log_level 5 1> 
/icc/log/autoguider_output.txt 2>&1 )
root      2744  0.1  0.1 101428  3268 ?        Sl   10:36   0:16 ./autoguider 
-co autoguider.properties -autoguider_log_level 5 -ccd_log_level 5 
-command_server_log_level 5 -object_log_level 5 -ngatcil_log_level 5
eng       6059  0.0  0.0   3924   704 pts/0    S+   14:53   0:00 grep autoguider
\end{verbatim}
whereas if the robotic software is not running you will see something like:
\begin{verbatim}
[eng@iucaaag ~]> ps waux | grep autoguider
eng       2646  0.0  0.0   4360   740 pts/0    S+   14:54   0:00 grep autoguider
\end{verbatim}

If the robotic software {\bf is} running, you need to stop it before running any of the low level test commands.

\section{Stopping the robotic software}
\label{sec:engineering_mode}

If the robotic software is running, it can be stopped by issuing the following commands:
\begin{verbatim}
su
(type in root password)
/icc/bin/autoguider/scripts/autoguider_engineering_mode
\end{verbatim}
The script will ensure the CCD was been warmed up before shutting down the robotic process.

\section{Low level command line testing}

The basic operation of the camera head can be tested with the following commands.

\subsection{test\_temperature\_low\_level}

This can be used to check the device driver is operating correctly, and that the control computer can communicate with the camera head correctly. It's main purpose is control and monitoring of the head CCD temperature.

The help option lists the command options:

\begin{verbatim}
[eng@iucaaag ~]> /icc/bin/autoguider/ccd/fli/test/i386-linux/test_temperature_low_level -help
Parsing Arguments.
Test Temperature (low level):Help.
test_temperature_low_level [-h[elp]] [-t[emperature] <target temp C>]
\end{verbatim}

Without any command line arguments the command will report some information about the camera head, and the current CCD temperature. Note because the device driver endpoint {\bf /dev/fliusb0} is owned by root, this command needs to be run as root (otherwise the command complains it can't find the camera head). Here is an example invocation:

\begin{verbatim}
[eng@iucaaag ~]> su
Password: 
[root@iucaaag eng]# /icc/bin/autoguider/ccd/fli/test/i386-linux/test_temperature_low_level
Parsing Arguments.
test_temperature_low_level: FLI library version: Software Development Library for Linux 1.104.
Find_FLI_Camera: Camera 0 has filename /dev/fliusb0 name MicroLine ML4720 and domain 258.
Find_FLI_Camera: Opening Camera with filename /dev/fliusb0 name MicroLine ML4720 and domain 258.
Camera Model: MicroLine ML4720
Serial Number: ML0832313
Hardware Revision: 256

CCD Camera cold finger Temperature: 15.00.
CCD Temperature: 15.00.
Base Temperature: 24.19.
Cooler Power: 20.00.
\end{verbatim}

The camera cooler can be tested by turning on the cooler by specifying the set-point. This is done by using the -temperature argument:

\begin{verbatim}
[root@iucaaag eng]# /icc/bin/autoguider/ccd/fli/test/i386-linux/test_temperature_low_level 
-temperature -30
Parsing Arguments.
test_temperature_low_level: FLI library version: Software Development Library for Linux 1.104.
Find_FLI_Camera: Camera 0 has filename /dev/fliusb0 name MicroLine ML4720 and domain 258.
Find_FLI_Camera: Opening Camera with filename /dev/fliusb0 name MicroLine ML4720 and domain 258.
Camera Model: MicroLine ML4720
Serial Number: ML0832313
Hardware Revision: 256
Firmware Revision: 512
Setting temperature to -30.00 C
CCD Camera cold finger Temperature: 15.00.
CCD Temperature: 15.00.
Base Temperature: 24.25.
Cooler Power: 20.00.
\end{verbatim}

The temperature and cooler can then be monitored using this command, and the CCD can be warmed back to ambient by specifying a positive temperature.

\subsection{test\_exposure\_low\_level}

This command is a low level program for taking an exposure with the camera head and saving the resulting image to a FITS file. The help argument returns the following:

\begin{verbatim}
[root@iucaaag eng]# /icc/bin/autoguider/ccd/fli/test/i386-linux/test_exposure_low_level -help
Parsing Arguments.
Test Exposure (low level):Help.
test_exposure_low_level <-b[ias]|-d[ark] <exposure length ms>|-e[xpose] <exposure length ms>>
        -f[its_filename] <fits filename> [-h[elp]] -t[emperature] <target temp C>
        [-xb[in] <n>] [-yb[in] <n>].
        [-w[indow] <ulx> <uly> <lrx> <lry>].
The window is defined in unbinned pixels with upper left corner (<ulx>,<uly>) and lower right corner (<lrx>,<lry>).
\end{verbatim}

The command should be run as the root user, because the device driver endpoint {\bf /dev/fliusb0} is owned by root (otherwise the command complains it can't find the camera head).
As an example, a 1 second exposure may be taken as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
[root@iucaaag eng]# /icc/bin/autoguider/ccd/fli/test/i386-linux/test_exposure_low_level 
-expose 1000 -fits_filename test1.fits  -xbin 1 -ybin 1
Parsing Arguments.
test_exposure_low_level: FLI library version: Software Development Library for Linux 1.104.
Find_FLI_Camera: Camera 0 has filename /dev/fliusb0 name MicroLine ML4720 and domain 258.
Find_FLI_Camera: Opening Camera with filename /dev/fliusb0 name MicroLine ML4720 and domain 258.
Camera Model: MicroLine ML4720
Serial Number: ML0832313
Hardware Revision: 256
Firmware Revision: 512
Pixel Size (microns): 0.00001300 x 0.00001300
Array Area: Upper Left (0,0) Lower Right (1072,1033)
Visible Area: Upper Left (24,9) Lower Right (1048,1033)
CCD Camera cold finger Temperature: -30.00.
CCD Temperature: -30.00.
Base Temperature: 34.06.
Cooler Power: 95.00.
main: Allocating image data (1072 x 1033).
main: Setting image data to (0,0) (1072,1033).
main: Setting 1000 ms Exposure up.
main: Setting Binning to 1,1.
main: Starting exposure.
main: Waiting for the exposure to finish.
main: Camera status is WAITING_FOR_TRIGGER.
main: Camera status is READING_CCD.
main:Remaining exposure length = 1000 ms.
main: Camera status is EXPOSING.
main: Camera status is READING_CCD.
main:Remaining exposure length = 59 ms.
main: Camera status is IDLE.
main: Camera has data ready.
main:Remaining exposure length = 0 ms.
\end{verbatim}

In this example, the resultant exposure was saved in the test1.fits image file, which can be viewed using your favourite FITS image viewer. Both {\bf ds9} and {\bf gaia} are installed on the autoguider control computer, though only ds9 is available for the root user.

This test command has options to take both bias and dark images, but has the camera has no shutter the CCD should be covered with light-tight material to properly takes these images. With a pinhole placed in front of the CCD test images can be taken to check the camera head is imaging correctly.

\section{Starting the robotic software}

After using the low level command line tools, the robotic software can be restarted as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Command the CCD camera head to warm up to ambient:
\begin{verbatim}
/icc/bin/autoguider/ccd/fli/test/i386-linux/test_temperature_low_level 
-temperature 15
\end{verbatim}
\item Issue a command to check the CCD camera head temperature until it is warm enough to reboot the machine:
\begin{verbatim}
/icc/bin/autoguider/ccd/fli/test/i386-linux/test_temperature_low_level 
\end{verbatim}
\item When the camera head is warm enough, reboot the machine:
\begin{verbatim}
su
reboot
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

If the camera head is on, the robotic software will be automatically started as part of the control computer boot-up procedure.

\section{Bench testing of the robotic software}

When the robotic software is running the following tasks should be considered before mounting the camera head on the telescope:

\begin{itemize}
\item Deciding on the CCD temperature set-point to use.
\item Creating a suitable set of dark frames for the temperature set-point.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Temperature set-point}

During bench testing at the ARI we found the FLI camera head maintained a stable temperature when running at -30 degrees centigrade. However, with different ambient temperature conditions a different temperature set-point may be required. The best value to use is one where the camera head can maintain the temperature set-point over all the expected ambient conditions when mounted on the telescope.

The robotic software temperature set-point can be modified by editing the {\bf autoguider.properties} file located in the {\bf /icc/bin/autoguider/c/i386-linux/} directory on the autoguider control computer. The {\bf ccd.temperature.target } property is the one to change. See the Autoguider Configuration Guide \cite{bib:autoguiderconfigurationguide} for details. The robotic software will need to be restarted for this change to take effect.

\section{Setting up dark frames}

Whilst the autoguider is set up on the bench you may wish to take a set of dark frames. For the FLI camera head this requires the CCD to be covered (with black card or similar), as the head has no shutter. It may be easier to do this before mounting the camera head on the telescope. Section 10 (Calibration) in the Autoguider User Guide \cite{bib:autoguideruserguide} describes the process for doing this.

\section{Basic robotic imaging tests}
\label{sec:basicroboticimaging}

Before mounting the camera head on the telescope a basic test of the imaging capabilities of the robotic software may be useful. To do this a pinhole should be fitted to the front of the camera.

With the camera connected and the control computer booted, and running the robotic software, the following commands can be issued to take an image:

\begin{verbatim}
send_command -h iucaaag -p 6571 -c "expose 1000"
test_getfits_command -h iucaaag -p 6571 -c "getfits field raw" -f test1.fits
ds9 test1.fits &
\end{verbatim}

This tells the autoguider to take a 1 second exposure, which will be saved in the field buffer. The field buffer is then saved to the FITS filename test1.fits, and ds9 is then invoked to view the taken image. Obviously the exposure length and FITS filename can be changed as appropriate.

Once bench testing is complete the autoguider is ready to be mounted
onto the telescope.  Note that unlike the original autoguider we recommend the autoguider head and
control computer are left powered up at all times connected to a UPS supply.


\section{Post telescope mounting tests}

Once the autoguider is mounted onto the telescope, and connected up and turned on, the following tests can be performed.
\begin{itemize}
\item The network testing in Section \ref{sec:networktesting} can be retested to ensure the network is working properly.\item Basic imaging of the camera head can be retested, see Section \ref{sec:basicroboticimaging}.
\end{itemize}

Before the autoguider can be used on-sky, the autoguider focus needs to be setup, and a suitable flat field frame acquired.

\subsection{Flat fielding}

The autoguider robotic software needs a suitable flat field to reduce field and guide images successfully These can be acquired at twilight or using dome flats. On the Liverpool Telescope we aim to get 10-30k counts in our flat field images, and find for dome flats this requires about 5 second exposures, and for sky flats 2 second exposures around 15 minutes after sunset. Given the IUCAA autoguider is using a different telescope and different camera head these values may need tuning.

Note the telescope will need to be configured such that light is
falling onto the autoguider (i.e. mirror cover open, science fold stowed etc.) for this
procedure to work. The procedure used is described in the {\bf Autoguider User Guide}, Section 8.2 (Calibration, sub-section Flat). The robotic software will need to be restarted after the new flat is installed for the new flat to take effect.

\section{On sky setup}

The tests in this section should be attempted once the dark frame and
flat field have been installed and require the operator to use the
telescope control system (TCS) to acquire objects.

This section should be read in conjunction with TTL document
``Generic 2.0m Telescope Astronomical Commissioning Installation
Procedure", especially Section 2.6 which describes the autoguider
geometry in detail.

During this work two TCS configuration files will need to be edited:
\begin{itemize}
\item The GUI config file describes the physical geometry of the autoguider camera itself. The file can contain specifications for multiple autoguiders each distinguished by a different KEYWORD. You need to update only the configuration of the single autoguider being commissioned. By default the TTL autoguider was called CASSEGRAIN.
\item The focus is specified in the INS config file. The file can
  contain specifications for multiple instruments each distinguished
  by a different KEYWORD. Issuing the TCS INSTRUMENT command changes
  the telescope focus so the autoguider focus needs to be configured
  separately for each instrument KEYWORD you use during observing.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Note that after making any changes to these configuration items, you
will need to use the APPLY option in the  TCS menu to ensure they 
are picked up.}

\subsection{Autoguider focus}

This section is written assuming the original TTL supplied autoguider
focus and deployment mechanism and science fold deployment mechanism
are present and operational.

Move the autoguider to the field centre and move the science fold
mirror out of the beam.  Setup the telescope as normal (i.e. in focus for science use and with
focus tracking enabled). 

Point the telescope at a bright (~8th magnitude) star
and then take images using the commands outlined in 
Section {\ref:basicroboticimaging}.  Examine the images
and adjust the autoguider focus stages using the TCS AGFOCUS command
until a good focus is obtained.

Once an acceptable autoguider focus is obtained, enter it into the
TCS INS config file (accessed from the TCS menu CONFIGURE option)
as the DEFAULT AGFOCUS for each instrument that is configured in that
file.

\subsection{Autoguider Pixel Scale}

Now, using the TCS HANDSET, apply a series of X and Y offsets of size
60 arcseconds to the telescope pointing, in each case obtaining an 
image with the autoguider.  For each image, determine the location
of the star on the autoguider and hence determine the pixel
scale (note simple trigonometry to determine the distance moved on the
autoguider may be necessary if the motion of the star on the
autoguider is 
rotated with respect to the telescope focal plane X,Y axes). Enter the pixel scale
value into 
the TCS CONFIG GUI file
items PIXEL SIZE X and PIXEL SIZE Y.

\subsection{Autoguider Geometry}

\setlength{\unitlength}{1in}
\begin{figure}[!h]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{picture}(6.0,5.0)(0.0,0.0)
			\put(0,0){\special{psfile=ag_rotation_20091109.eps   hscale=35 vscale=35}}

	\end{center}
	\caption{Example plot of autoguider centroids versus time in case of crosstalk
        (lower panel) and no crosstalk (upper panel).}
	\label{fig:geometry} 
\end{figure}

Assuming the autoguider has been placed back on the same stage
as the original TTL autoguider, this should be roughly correct.  If
the image is flipped with respect to the original
autoguider the the TCS CONFIGURE GUI items ROT SENSE, FLIP X and 
FLIP Y will need to be adjusted.  

The easiest way to determine if this is the case is to use the
autoguider closed loop.  Therefore pointing at the bright star,
issue the TCS command:
\begin{verbatim}
AUTOGUIDE ON
\end{verbatim}
and observe if the telescope pointing remains roughly stable
or shoots off in one direction indicating an error in one or
more of these quantities.

Once the basic image orientation is confirmed, then use the
TCS HANDSET to offset the telescope in X and Y by a few arcseconds
and confirm that the telescope pointing is compensated to remove that
offset.  Use of the Guide packet logging and graphing tools described
in Section 5.2 of the Autoguider User Guide will help here.

Assuming the new camera head is replacing a previous, correctly configured camera
there is no need to completely re-derive the camera orientation. (See T2-010-5180 
"Generic 2.0m Telescope Astronomical Commissioning Installation Procedure" 
Section 2.6). To verify the existing orientation configuration,
induce telescope offsets parallel to the guider X, Y axes. Any error in the rotation 
configuration will result in cross-talk between the axes and the autoguider 
will loop back to the guiding centre instead of moving in a straight line. 
See figure \ref{geometry} for an example running on the Liverpool Telescope. 
The offsets must be smaller than the guide window size or you will simply 
lose the star. If such crosstalk is found then the TCS CONFIG GUI ROTATION 
parameter should be adjusted.

How you create offsets aligned with X,Y in the autoguider focal plane depends on where the
camera head has been installed. 
* In most common configurations, the autoguider CCD
and main imaging camera are likely to be roughly aligned to each other anyway and then
simply using X,Y offsets on the TCS HANDSET will work. 
* If the autoguider has been installed at some tilted angle then careful choice a certain 
cassegrain rotator angle will align Alt,Az offsets on the TCS HANDSET with the autoguider 
axes. To find the cassegrain mount angle which will create this special alignment of alt,az with
autoguider X,Y, start by using the current value of ROTATION in the TCS GUI configuration.


\subsection{Autoguider Gain}

Note that if guiding seems generally unstable without a preferred
direction or spiral pattern it may simply reflect too high a system
gain,in which case you should reduce the gain by increasing the LOOP GAIN
values in the TCS CONFIG GUI file.  At LT we use values of 8.0.
