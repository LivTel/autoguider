Subject: autoguider thoughts


-1.  Guide star selection.  Two modes:

    a) A user specified pixel.  Pick the guide star nearest that pixel

    b) brightest, non-saturated star on the frame that is more than
       a configurable number pixels from edge of frame and meets
       configurable ellipticity and no-near neighbour criteria.

0.  Exposure times when acquiring.  Two modes:

    a)  A fixed user specified time.

    b)  An autoscaling time, starting from a configurable value and
        attempting to meet criteria b) in guide star selection.  
Configurable
        maximum and minimum exposure times.  If you reach max or min and 
no
        suitable guide star ACQUISTION_FAILED.

1.  Exposure times when guiding.  Two modes:

     a)  a fixed, user specified time

     b) an autoscaling time, based on the counts of the current guide 
object,
        scale factors 0.5x and 2x.  Beware of "borderline" cases where 
you would
        keep flicking between the two.  Configurable maximum and minimum
        exposure times.  If you reach maximum GUIDE_STAR_LOST.  If you 
reach
        minimum ???

2.  Need rolling graphs of X, Y, counts and FWHM, reset each time you 
restart guiding.
     Also log this information in a separate file for each "guide 
instance", and
     put the guide instance ID in the FITS headers for the science 
instruments so
     we can reconstruct guide info when we get dodgy RATCam images for 
example.

3.  May need to worry about scattered light causing field gradients in 
full frame mode.
     May need to do 2d background fit to allow decent 
thresholding/object detection.

4.  Window size.  Two modes:

    a) fixed user specified

    b) autoscaling based on a configurable multiple of  current FWHM
