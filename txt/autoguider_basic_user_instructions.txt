Autoguider control system startup:
----------------------------------
cd /icc/bin/autoguider/c/i386-linux
./autoguider -co autoguider.properties -autoguider_log_level 2047 -ccd_log_level 3871 -command_server_log_level 3 -object_log_level 196608 -ngatcil_log_level 29
#-ngatcil_log_level 31

Commands:
---------

cd /home/dev/bin/autoguider/commandserver/test/i386-linux/
./send_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "help"

Use 'send_command' to send all commands to the autoguider _except_ ones that return binary data, for
those use 'test_getfits_command'. The commands that return binary data are: 'getfits [field|guide] [raw|reduced]'.

Log files
---------

Logs appear in the '/icc/log' directory. Ensure you are tailing the latest one
(which changes every hour), otherwise you won't know what is going on.

Keep an eye out for error files appearing in the directory, this will
tell you when a command has failed.


Autoguider control system shutdown:
-----------------------------------

cd /home/dev/bin/autoguider/commandserver/test/i386-linux/
./send_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "shutdown"

Make sure you do this before turning the camera electronics off, so the 
head is warmed to a sensible value.

Simple exposures
----------------

cd /icc/bin/autoguider/commandserver/test/i386-linux/
Expose:
./send_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "expose 1000"
(1000 is the exposure length in milliseconds)
Get raw output:
./test_getfits_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "getfits field raw" -f test.fits
Display:
gaia test.fits
Also, if you have suitable darks/flats, get reduced output:
./test_getfits_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "getfits field reduced" -f test_reduced.fits

How do I create a dark library:
-------------------------------

cd /icc/bin/autoguider/scripts
./autoguider_make_dark_list

This in turn calls autoguider_make_dark for a list of exposure lengths.

Basically, this (internally) does:
"field dark off" to turn off dark subtraction.
"field flat off" to turn off flat fielding.
"field object off" to turn off object detection.
"expose ${exposure_length}" x N to get N frames.
fits_median to median the raw files.

Follow the instructions to turn back on dark subtraction/flat fielding/object detection as needed afterwards.

Note, you have to restart the software after building a new dark library for them to be read (not strictly true,
so long as your next exposure is a different length to the one currently in the dark buffer).

See '/icc/bin/autoguider/c/i386-linux/autoguider.properties', keywords:
'dark.filename.1.1.<exposure_length>' for location of dark library (usually /icc/dprt/dark/).

How do I create a flat field:
-----------------------------

Create a dark library first (and restart the software)!

Determine a suitable exposure length to get suitable counts (10-30k), using the single exposure
command above.

cd /icc/bin/autoguider/scripts
./autoguider_make_flat -exposure_length <ms> -exposure_count <n> -output /icc/dprt/flat/flat_1_1.fits

Follow the instructions to turn back on dark subtraction/flat fielding/object detection as needed afterwards.

Note, you have to restart the software after building a new flat library for it to be read.

This internally does the following:
"field dark on"  - make sure dark subtraction is on.
"field flat off" - make sure flat fielding is off.
"field object off" - turn off object detection.
for N frame:
  expose ${exposure_length}
  "getfits field reduced"
fits_median frames
fits_normalise frames

See '/icc/bin/autoguider/c/i386-linux/autoguider.properties', keywords:
'flat.filename.1.1' for location of flat library (usually /icc/dprt/flat/).

I want to make a movie:
----------------------

Start by taking a full frame:
cd /icc/bin/autoguider/commandserver/test/i386-linux/
./send_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "expose 1000"
./test_getfits_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "getfits field raw" -f test.fits
gaiadisp test.fits

Choose your fave bit:

./send_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "guide window <sx> <sy> <ex> <ey>"
./send_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "guide exposure_length 1000"

Start the guide loop:
./send_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "guide on"

Lots of stuff should now be appearing in the log file....

Stop the guide loop:
./send_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "guide off"

See an image:
./test_getfits_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "getfits guide raw" -f test.fits
or
./test_getfits_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "getfits guide reduced" -f test.fits

gaiadisp test.fits

See a movie:

cd /icc/bin/autoguider/scripts
./autoguider_get_guide_frames [-gaiadisp][-ds9disp [-ds9objects]][-raw|-reduced][-delete]

If '-delete' is specified each frame is deleted after viewing, otherwise a series of
timestamped FITS images will be left after this is run.

Temperature control
-------------------

Note the AG is currenly set to run at -40 deg C, see 
'ccd.temperature.target' in 'autoguider.properties'.
You should warm the CCD to at least 0C before turning it off . The 'shutdown' command warms up the CCD automatically 
so long as the 'ccd.temperature.ramp_to_ambient' configuration is true.

Also controlable by sending:
./send_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "temperature set <C>"
./send_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "temperature cooler on"
and monitoring using:
./send_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "status temperature get"
which returns '0 0.0' (first 0 means 'success', second is temperature).
also:
./send_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "status temperature status"

Don't change the temperature unless you have to.
