TODO
----
FITS headers meta-information
  - basic (done)
  - from config file
  - commands to add/amend/delete user list
GUI
TCS Interface
  - how does telescope offsets work?
  - finish SDB interface
requires ability to startup and shutdown CCD independantly of control systems (TCS advanced interface)
Add ability to reload dark/flat (after creation of new one!)
add field (guide?) gradient calculation/subtraction
add alternative guide centroid - no object detection - whole frame centroiding
offbys TCS handling
command_server.c: multi-reads of long text messages can fail if a partial read ends on a '\n' character. See diddly.
command replies: add ability to put error string into replies for more info.
reseting of error numbers, review libdprt_object/libestar_config and autoguider.

DONE
----
Control of scaling of UDP guide packet timecode value.
guide exposure length initial value.
guide window tracking - also non-sidereal tracking.
configurable pixels for detecting centroid near edge rather than fwhm based calculation
configurable pixels for guide window tracking rather than fwhm based calculation
autoscaling of exposure length in guide loop for cloud.
Autobooter support to deployment script
SDB interface
autoguider on
autoguider off
autoguider_field, loop until suitable objects detected or error.
scaling of exposure lengths in guide loop based on guide objects peak/total counts
add guide packets to tcs
add ags cil handling
log_level <autoguider|ccd|command_server|object|ngatcil> <n>
autoguider_object.c
Guide Objects : Where is it on the CCD (to send to TCS)
Guide Objects : Where is it on the buffer (to send to GUIs)
Guide Objects : Frame number for logging
Guide Objects : Guide number for logging
If client end Ctrl-C then when autoguider tries to send reply exits with Broken Pipe to command line.
'Broken pipe' if client end dies:
	- signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN)' somewhere at the start of your program. You will get an EPIPE error return when send/write fails due to a broken pipe.
	- POSIX, use sigaction instead?
	- Another less portable solution is to pass the MSG_NOSIGNAL flag to send(). This has the same effect.
change make dark to turn off all 3 reductions explicitly. Should restore previous settings at end?
change make flat to turn on dark subtraction, and off flat/object reductions explicitly. Should restore previous settings at end?
make failure to load specified dark and flat an error. Don't turn off the boolean.
