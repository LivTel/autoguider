AgsUtil.c
---------

iAgsSendCilMsg : Sends a CIL message to a software process.
Convers data to network byte order, uses eCilSend to send data.

iAgsCheckAndSet : Sets Oid in OidTable. CHanged flag is set if value changes.
		Change value always set for D_AGS_GUIDEMAG / D_AGS_CENTROIDX / D_AGS_CENTROIDY / D_AGS_FWHM / D_AGS_INTTIME
eTimGetTime is used to generate timestamp.


AgsMain.c
---------

main:
	iAgsSetup
	iAgsMonitorAgg
	iAgsShutdown

iAgsMonitorAgg :
	       eCilFlush
	       while ( Status != SYS_FAILED_STATE )
		     iAgsReceiveMessage
		     if (iAgsData.SdbSubmitReq == TRUE)
			iAgsSubmitStatus
	             iAgsCheckSafeState

AgsPrivate.h
------------
/* Structure for SDB submissions */
typedef struct iAgsSdbDat_e iAgsSdbData_t

iAgsOidTable_t;

/*
** This table is indexed into by Oid.
** The order of each block of items must be the same as that defined in the
** SptDataID list in Spt.h. The Oid Table must be in the same order as
** the enumerated Datum Ids.  When adding new OIDs to this table ensure 
** that the I_AGS_FINAL_DATA_ID etc are updated if appropriate.
*/

I_AGS_EXTERN iAgsOidTable_t iAgsOidTable[]

List of function declarations in each file.

AgsReport.c
-----------

iAgsSubmitStatus : Submits status to the SDB.
 Uses iAgsSdbData_t and copied Changed entries from iAgsOidTable.
Put into iAgsData.SdbSubmissionMsg, then iAgsSendCilMsg called.

AgsInit.c
---------
iAgsSetup: Sets up common fields in iAgsData.SdbSubmissionMsg.

Ags.h
-----

/* Enumerated list of states reported to the SDB by the autoguider. */
typedef enum eAgsState_e

/* Global data for submission to the Status Database (SDB) */
typedef enum eAgsDataId_e

AgsProcess.c
------------

iAgsProcessHeartbeat : Processes heartbeat - notice replies with state information.

iAgsProcessSafeState : Resubmits everyhting to the SDB

iAgsProcessActivate : Submits all the fields to the SDB

iAgsReceiveReply : AGG INFO reply submits everything to SDB structure.

AgsReply.c
----------

Replies to client mesages.

iAgsComReply:
Replies filled win with Process State, retrieved by iAgsGetState, should be STS_STATE_OKAY.
Stored oddly in ActualState?

Steve says:

I use 1980 5th Jan at 0:0:0UT - cant recall where I found this but it was
in some TTL document - e.g. the Cil 'ICD' or whatever it was called.

I looked this up recently on the web and came up with a different value -
something like 6th Jan 1980 at noon.

date -d "Jan 5 00:00:00 +00 1980"
Sat Jan  5 00:00:00 GMT 1980

date -d "Jan 5 00:00:00 +00 1980" "+%s"
315878400

D_AGS_AG_STATE

See P23 of the AG ICD. Suggests eAgsAgState_t, this really appears to be eAgsState_t.


Cil.c
-----

eCilSend:

BufferLen = I_CIL_HDRBLK_SIZE + MsgPtr->DataLen;
CilPrivate.h:#define I_CIL_HDRBLK_SIZE  28  /* Number of bytes used in CIL header */

eCilConvert32bitArray:
Note assumes data buffer is Uint32_t, and casts accordingly.
