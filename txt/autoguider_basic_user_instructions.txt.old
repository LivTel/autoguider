See autoguider_commands.txt:

Basically, follow the "Autoguider control system startup" section to run 
the control system. (oh, you might have to lose the -ngatcil_log_level 
bit, that doesn't exist in your version yet).

Logs appear in the '/icc/log' directory to peruse, 
configuration is in the 'autoguider.properties' file in the 
/icc/bin/autoguider/c/i386-linux directory.

You interact with the system as follows:
cd /icc/bin/autoguider/commandserver/test/i386-linux/
./send_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "help"

e.g. To take an exposure:
cd /icc/bin/autoguider/commandserver/test/i386-linux/
./send_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "expose 1000"
./test_getfits_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "getfits field raw" -f test.fits
gaia test.fits

There are some more advanced commands in the '/icc/bin/autoguider/scripts'
directory.

Note the AG is currenly set to run at 0 deg C, see 
'ccd.temperature.target' in 'autoguider.properties'.
You should warm the CCD to at least 0C before turning it off (which is why 
it runs at 0C atm). The 'shutdown' command warms up the CCD automatically 
so long as the 'ccd.temperature.ramp_to_ambient' configuration is true.
