Commands
--------

Commands are in:
/icc/bin/autoguider/commandserver/test/i386-linux/
but should be aliased in the cshrc.

Scripts are in:
/icc/bin/autoguider/scripts

Guiding
-------
To do long guided observations:
i) with the AG guiding normally

Best done by commanding the autoguider from the TCS TUI i.e.:
autoguide on brightest
autoguide on rank <n>
autoguide on pixel <x> <y>

Only "brightest" has been extensively tested, but pixel <x> <y> might be useful for using the same guide star
for consecutive guides etc...

ii) with the AG observing, centroiding and logging, but not sending the guide packets to the TCS.

This can be done by commanding the autoguider internally e.g.:
send_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "autoguide on brightest"
send_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "autoguide on pixel <x> <y>"

This will still send the guide packets to the TCS (TCS TUI screen 2), but they should not be acted on
(no corrections on TCS screen 1). If you want to be sure:

send_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "guide packet off"
should stop sending guide packets to the TCS, remember to issue:
send_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "guide packet on"
before using the autoguider normally.

send_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "status guide packet"
should give the current state (returns "0 true" or "0 false")

Starting the autoguider can also be done at a lower level :- i.e. manually;
- fielding
- selecting a guide object or:
  - selecting a guide window
  - selecting a guide exposure length
- switching the guide loop on/off

Let me know if you need to go to that level.

Saving the guide images
-----------------------

test_getfits_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "getfits field raw" -f test.fits
save the last raw field
test_getfits_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "getfits field reduced" -f test.fits
save the last reduced field
test_getfits_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "getfits guide raw" -f test.fits
save the last raw guide window
test_getfits_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "getfits guide reduced" -f test.fits
save the last reduced guide window

See the "autoguider_get_guide_frames" script, which allows you to save runs of guide frames and display them...

Be aware of the cron scripts "autoguider_get_guide_frames_cron" and "autoguider_rm_guide_frames_cron", which try
and save a guide frame once a minute whilst guiding, and delete them a week later. I don't think they work at the moment, it'd be nice to figure out why ;-), but if you fix them you may want to comment them out of the crontab whilst doing
manual stuff...

Logs
----

Are in the /icc/log directory.

You might want to look at the:
autoguider_get_guide_packets script, which extracts guide packets from a log file, and
autoguider_guide_packets_to_csv script, which converts a useful subset of autoguider_get_guide_packets output to csv format.

Also
autoguider_get_object_list, extracts detected object lists from a log file, and
autoguider_object_list_to_csv which converts the output of autoguider_get_object_list to csv format.
