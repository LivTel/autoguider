Heres what you need to do for robotic testing of the autoguider.

Start of night
--------------

Bloke starting up the telescope needs to do the following:

ssh eng@acc
cd /icc/bin/autoguider/c/i386-linux
./autoguider -co autoguider.properties -autoguider_log_level 2047 -ccd_log_level 3871 -command_server_log_level 3 -object_log_level 196608 -ngatcil_log_level 13
#-ngatcil_log_level 15

You'll probably find the terminal times out after an hour or two of no input - guess this needs to be put into a script.

ssh maintain@mcc
/opt/ttl/util/testinject < inject2.txt

This tells the TCS (via the SDB) that the autoguider is guiding and doing 1 second exposures.

End of night
------------

You may want to issue the following:
ssh eng@acc
send_command -h autoguider1 -p 6571 -c "shutdown"

This will warm up the CCD and shut the system down.

RCS control
-----------

The CIL interface doesn't really work properly at the moment (well, you can send "autoguide off" successfully,
but the TCS doesn't like my replies! (and I can't even figure out how to test "autoguide on")).

So, use the socket text interface. This is on the acc, port 6571. This is a telnet like interface in that you send a text string ('\n' terminated) and get a string reply per connection. I think you can use telnet for testing, but normally called via the 'send_command' program (source in ~dev/src/autoguider/commandserver/test/send_command.c, calling library
functions in ~dev/src/autoguider/commandserver/c/command_server.c). Most replies start with a number, '0' is success, non-zero is an error. The error replies are a bit basic, you have to look in the log files to figure out whats really happening (acc:/icc/log/).

RCS start of night
------------------

"guide exposure_length 1000 lock" - you may wish to issue this to lock guide loop exposure lengths to 1000ms, this is
the same length as injected into the SDB, so the TCS will then issue the correct correction per axis demand, otherwise it won't....

To the TCS:
"agsel cass"
"agradial 0"
"agfocus 2.8"

RCS autoguiding
---------------

"autoguide on rank 0" - turn the autoguider on and guide on the brightest object.
"autoguide on brightest" might work "autoguide on pixel <x> <y>" definately doesn't at the moment.

The TCS will of course then need "autoguide receive".

"autoguide off" - turn off the autoguider.

You will have to send "autoguide off" to the TCS as well to stop it expecting packets.

See if it's still guiding:
"status guide active" should return "0 true" if it's guiding.

If you want to monitor temperature etc:
"status temperature get" will return something like "0 -39.5", -40C is the normal temperature atm.

autoguider_basic_user_instructions.txt : basic manual usage instructions - shows how to use low level commands
(field/guide) rather than "autoguide on/off".
