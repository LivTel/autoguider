There is additional information required by the Tcs from the Sdb to
autoguide correctly.

1. The integration time.
2. A valid autoguider state.

As a short term fix to test the guiding you can use the attached script
along with the testinject utility to "force" these values in the Sdb,
i.e. from the mcc

   $ testinject < inj.txt

The inj.txt file contains the following | + comments:

	AGS			|subsystem
	INTTIME		|datum (integration time)
	3E8			|integration time, msec, (hex)
	MSEC_UNITS		|units
	Y			|another?
	AGS			|subsystem
	AGSTATE		|datum (autoguider state)
	1005			|state (interactive guiding)
	NO_UNITS		|units
	N			|another?

The integration time is set to 1000 msec in this example - it is used to
determine how much of the guiding correction is applied at each 10Hz
tick.
