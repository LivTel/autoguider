- We don't have an AG GUI (kind of already says this)
- What subset of the TCS interface do we support?
     autoguide on brightest
	       on rank
	       on pixel x y
     autoguide off
START_SESSION?
END_SESSION?

     All exist in the software - have they ever been tested?
     We do not support:
	autoguider on range <mmag1> <mmag2>
	config exp_time <time> (CIL command only?)
	config frame_rate <n> (CIL command only?)
	config frame_average <n> (CIL command only?)
	config calib <prop> <offset> (configure CCD counts->astro mags) (CIL command only?)
	AGG_LOGGING (CIL command only?)
- What version of the TTL SDB/ AG centroid interface are we compatible with?
- AG system performance i.e. closed loop cycle time - text suggests we are not guaranteeing
  any particular performance? (fine by me)
- Linking:
	Standard AG libraries:
	libautoguider_commandserver
	libautoguider_ngatcil
	libautoguider_ccd_general

	Logging:
	liblog_udp
	Note this means the AG emits logging UDP packets - these can be ignored?

	libcfitsio
	Are we allowed to bundle this as part of software for sale? License issues? 
	Shouldn't really be a problem as it's free?

	DpRt libraries:
	libdprt_object
	libdprt_libfits
	liblt_filenames
	Are we OK to release these? Probably.

	General LT libraries
	libngatastro
	MJD calc.

	eSTAR libraries
	libestar_config
	OK
- Should we be specifying what telemetry the software generates i.e. log files?
- TTL comms:
  - TCC (tcc) : 13021 : TCS CIL UDP port
  - TCC (tcc) : 13025 : Guide packets sent over this port to TCS
  - AGS (acc) : 13024 : AGS CIL UDP port (autoguider software CIL server command port)
  - SCC (scc) : 13002 : CHB (continuous heartbeat) reply port
  - SCC (scc) : 13001 : Replies to MCP (master control process) requests
  - MCC (mcc) : 13011 : SDB submissions (centroids, AG state etc)

Cil messages received on AGS CIL UDP port. Services:
 - CHB packets
   - send CHB response (scc:13002)
 - MCP packets
     - Ignores Shutdown packet
     - Ignores activate packet (but sends correct response) (scc:13001)
     - Ignores safestate packet (but sends correct response) (scc:13001)
 - TCS Packets
     - autoguide on brightest (tcc:13025)
     - autoguide on rank  (tcc:13025)
     - autoguide on pixel x y  (tcc:13025)
     - autoguide off  (tcc:13025)
     - AGS_START_SESSION (update SDB State, send TCS reply(tcc:13025))
     - AGS_END_SESSION (tcc:13025)
 - SDB packets (not processed yet (SDB request responses).

Currently in use on the LT (from Steve):
--------------------------
AUTOGUIDE ON BRIGHTEST
dont think weve ever used rank or pixel and the phase2 doesnt support that now anyway

AUTOGUIDE OFF

SHOW AUTOGUIDER to get ag status 

via the internal telnet interface I use:

status temperature get

status guide active
