A few comments. Most are subtleties and complications not required in

Should that be brightest nowhere near saturated star, considering point 
1b below?

Define T_min as the shortest exposure the AG can do. You could then say 
brightest star if exposure > 4 T_min, otherwise choose star at about 
half the full well.

If you reach minimum:
i) Go to FAIL state
ii) Go to RETRY state which tells RCS or instrument to abandon the 
current exposure, but try again and this time the AG uses the second 
brightest star
iii) Give up on the current star and try a reacquire looking for a 
fainter guide star but leave the telescope blindly observing. This 
seems too risky to me.

I'd the like the facility for both X,Y in the guide window and X,Y in 
the full CCD.

Another common trick to greatly enhance source detection is convolve 
the image with a 2D gaussian  equal to the seeing. This exaggerates the 
contrast of objects with profiles similar to the convolution kernel. It 
takes time of course. You also have the cosmic ray removal algorithm in 
the crreject.c programs in libdprt if you want them.

Within MIN and MAX values.
