TCP UDP guide packet timecode scaling
-------------------------------------

This was previously hardcoded to 2.0f, in other words the TCS UDP guide packet
(N.B. not the SDB centroid interface) contained a timecode twice the loop cadence.
According to the docs (Autoguider to TCS Interface Control Document, Guiding corrections interface), this
is the time in seconds until the next packet is sent - if no packet is received in twice this value the 
link is assumed broken.

However, Rob was concerned this value may be used to calculate the correction applied to the axes for each packet, so
I have added some control to the scaling value.

"guide timecode_scaling <float value>" allows you to set the scaling interactively (before or during a guiding run).
A value of < 0.5 should cause the TCS to assume the link is broken - really value 1.0 or greater should be used.
"status guide timecode_scaling" gets the current value. The timecode of the last packet is shown in the TCS, 
however you could figure out what was sent using this value multiplied by "status guide cadence".

To make any new value the default, change the following in the config file:

# What number to multiply the guide loop cadence by to construct the TCS UDP packet timecode with.
# Should normally be 1.0 or greater, < ~0.5 will probably cause autoguiding to fail.
guide.timecode.scale			=2.0

The current default is 2.0, same as the hardcoded value was.
 
Guide window status
-------------------

This can now be retrieved using the "status guide window" command. Might be usful for guide window tracking debugging.
