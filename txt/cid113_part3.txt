Hi guys,

Many thanks for the extra source code you sent me. I (eventually) managed to figure out what
I was doing wrong, and I now can talk to the SDB successfully.

And so, onto the next problem. I can't get the TCS to send me an "autoguide on" command, when I issue this to the TUI
it responds "Autoguider not ready to receive commands." (and I believe no CIL packet is sent to the AGS CIL port). I had previously issued an "agsel cass".

Also on the TCS Display client, screen 2, it reports: 

Autoguider name: CASSEGRAIN
Autoguider status Autoguider not accepting commands.
AG service state OKAY.

I'm guessing the "Autoguider status" is what the TCS is checking? 

I'm setting the AGSTATE SDB entry to "IDLE" at this point, though I bypassed the "INITIALISING" state at startup
(I go straight from OFF to IDLE). This seems to be reflected on the TCS Display, screen 1, which says 
"Autoguider   NOT GUIDING".

I'm also now responding to CHB heartbeats (with status SYS_OKAY_STATE), 
this seems to be reflected in the TCS Display screen 2 "AG service state OKAY", and also in the ECI. 

So, can you tell me how the TCS decides the autoguider is "not accepting commands"?

cheers

Chris
